Every card in the french deck has a rank (formal rank):
Ace, Two through Ten, Jack, Queen, King

For computational purposes, every rank has a numeric equivalent (int rank). 
Ace is 1, the numbers match themselves, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13

The formal rank and numeric rank are interchangeable. Ace is always 1, Jack is always 11.

The value of each rank varies from game to game. The value is a numeric translation into how valuable a rank is for a given game.
When hierarchy is based on low ace, the value is the same as the numeric rank.
When hierarchy is based on high ace, the value for each rank is different. Every valueis one less than the numeric rank except for ace which has value 13.
There are many other hierarchies.

Every card also has a suite. This is simpler: the value of each suite is based on alphabetical ordering. Never changes. I think.
Club=1, Diamond=2, Heart=3, Spade=4
