When clonning this repository you have to install Node.js, once that is done all you have to do is run npm install in the command line to install all the dependencies needed.

Before merging a branch into main, submit a pull request and request a couple people from the group to look over the code, test it, etc (can add them on the right side after clicking on the pull request button). After merging into main, delete your branch (there will be an option to delete it after it has been merged into main) so there aren't any commit history issues later on.
