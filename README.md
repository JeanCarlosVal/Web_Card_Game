When cloning this repository you have to install Node.js, once that is done all you have to do is run npm install in the command line to install all the dependencies needed.

Before merging a branch into main, submit a pull request and request a couple people from the group to look over the code, test it, etc (can add them on the right side after clicking on the pull request button).

Before submitting a pull request and trying to merge, go to your terminal (make sure you're in your project's directory):
1) git checkout main (check out to your local main)
2) git pull (updates your local main to reflect what's here in the repo, if anything has been pushed up to it since you created your branch)
3) git checkout <your branch> (go back to your branch)
4) git merge main, resolve any merge conflicts (merges any pulled changes into your branch so you are now up to date)
5) make sure the application still works as intended after amending any merge conflicts

After merging into main here on github, delete your branch (there will be an option to delete it after it has been merged into main) so there aren't any commit history issues later on.
  
When creating a new branch
1) git checkout main
2) git pull
3) git checkout <new branch name>
  
This ensures your local copy of main is completely up to date before making a new branch to work off of.
